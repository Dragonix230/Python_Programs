## 5. Even or Odd Check
**Description:**  
This program checks if a number is even or odd.

**Key Features:**  
- User input for a number.  
- Validates numeric input.  
- Outputs whether the number is even or odd.

---

## 6. Triangle Validity Check
**Description:**  
This program checks if a triangle is valid based on the lengths of its three sides.

**Key Features:**  
- User input for the three sides of the triangle.  
- Checks the triangle inequality theorem (sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side).  
- Outputs whether the triangle is valid or not.

## 8. Gross Salary Calculation
**Description:**  
This program calculates the gross salary of an employee based on their basic salary and predefined rules for HRA and DA.

**Key Features:**  
- User input for the basic salary.  
- Calculates HRA and DA based on salary slabs:  
  - **Basic Salary <= 10,000:** HRA = 20%, DA = 80%  
  - **Basic Salary <= 20,000:** HRA = 25%, DA = 90%  
  - **Basic Salary > 20,000:** HRA = 30%, DA = 95%  
- Outputs the gross salary.

## 9. Show Days Using Switch Case
**Description:**  
This program allows the user to input a number (1–7) and displays the corresponding day of the week.

**Key Features:**  
- Simulates a switch-case structure using conditional statements.  
- Outputs the day corresponding to the input number.

---

## 10. Print Numbers Using While Loop
**Description:**  
This program prints numbers from 0 to 5 using a `while` loop.

**Key Features:**  
- Demonstrates the use of a `while` loop.  
- Outputs numbers sequentially from 0 to 5.

## How to Use
1. Copy each program into a Python file (e.g., `triangle_validity.py`, `profit_or_loss.py`, etc.).  
2. Run the Python file using a Python interpreter (`python filename.py`).  
3. Follow the prompts to provide input and see the results.
